Imagine if you could gather the energy from every star within a 

From thousands of galaxies, each with billions of stars.

Imagine, you could take this kind of power, and use it to fire the 

Imagine the damage you could do.

It turns out, you don't need to imagine it.

These exist, and they're called gamma ray bursts.

But what are these cosmic snipers?

And what happens if one takes a shot at Earth?

To understand gamma ray bursts, we first have to understand gamma 

Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation â€“ waves which carry 

Visible light is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum: it's 

At lower energies, there are radio waves, microwaves and 

And at higher energies: ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays.

Gamma rays are incredibly powerful.

A single gamma ray photon, is more energetic than a million 

Their high energy makes gamma rays a form of ionizing radiation.

Meaning they are energetic enough, to break apart atomic bonds.

This makes them dangerous to you and me.

Ionizing radiation disrupts the delicate biochemical machinery 

like a 9mm bullet through a clock.

Fortunately, on Earth, the ozone layer blocks gamma rays. 

But if the atmosphere blocks gamma rays from space

how were gamma ray bursts (or GRBs) from space ever discovered?

the USA sent up spy satellites, which could detect gamma rays from 

They didn't see any bombs, but they did observe faint bursts 

To date, this may be the only major scientific discovery made by 

Astronomers use telescopes see different kinds of light to make 

And these spy satellites gave them a new pair of eyes.

They were a mystery for thirty years but eventually

we discovered the source of a GRB: a galaxy six billion light 

If a GRB can be seen from such a distance, then it must be 

Releasing more energy in a second than the sun will, in its entire 

Making GRBs, the brightest events in the universe.

GRBs, accompany some of the most violent, cataclysmic deaths in 

There are two types of gamma ray bursts:

short and long, and each has their own source.

Long GRBs last about a minute, and scientist think they are 

when the core of a massive star collapses to become a black hole.

Short GRBs last a second, and are produced when two neutron stars 

Over millions of years, their orbits decay by emmiting 

Once they are close enough to touch, they crash and splash into 

Both supernova and neutron star mergers the same thing:

black holes, surrounded by a magnetized disc of gas left over from 

In these environments, the rotation winds up the magnetic field, 

traveling at nearly the speed of light.

The gas in this funnel creates two tight jets of high energy gamma 

So unlike other cosmic explosions, which spread out and fade

GRBs say focused, and can been seen from much further.

Any more detail would require too much mathematics for a YouTube 

The universe is full of these cosmic snipers, firing blindly and 

and they're hitting us all the time.

On average, we detect one per day. Fortunately, most are 

All the bursts we have detected so far, originated outside the 

But a nearby GRB could be disastrous

if one goes off within a few light years of us, it would totally 

Or at least, the half that's facing it.

But even a more distant GRB could still end life on Earth.

And it wouldn't need to score a head-shot to kill us.

If originating from a few thousand light years away

it would be a hundred light years wide by the time it reaches us

washing over the Solar System like a tidal wave.

Again, the ozone layer protects us, but it's better equipped to 

A gamma ray burst would overwhelm it, leaving us exposed to deadly 

Ozone takes years to replenish itself by natural processes

which is more than enough time for the sun to burn the Earth 

Or at least, to kill most complex life.

In fact, this may have already happened.

A GRB has been suggested as one possible cause of the Ordovician 

that eradicated almost 85% of all marine species.

Although it's pretty much impossible to prove.

Gamma ray bursts could even be one reason we don't see life 

They might be wiping clean huge chucks of it, on a regular basis.

It's been suggested, that because of GRBs, only 10% of all 

In a galaxy like ours, there may only be one GRB per millennia.

And to harm us, they must be close and directed at us.

But since gamma rays travel at the speed of light, we won't know 

So, there could already be a GRB on its way to kill us all, and we
