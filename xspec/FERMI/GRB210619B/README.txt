>> ToF (seconds)

ToF_Fermi_ASIM = 0.0227
ToF_KW_ASIM = -2.6183 

calculated t_shift = -0.042786


>> Energy range
NaI: 8-1000 keV
BGO: 150 keV - 40MeV

>>Background estimated from T0-130 to T0-5 s 

>>Spectra retrived from T0+0.512 to T0+0.768 s
src time does capture the max count rate of the burst

>>Grouping in xspec
used grppha to group the channels by grou min 20
