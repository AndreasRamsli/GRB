    >> Be careful when finding the ra,dec angles for the burst!
    >> Do not use the annulus center (wrong), but find the location the triagulation intersects
    >> Use IPN or XRT location instument

>> TODO: extract files for GRB181222B and load them into xspec. Done.
    Ran into troubles with the fitting. High unceartanty for the high energies
    
    
>> xspec questions for Cristiano
    >> find keyword for showing which file im using (same as when you load the data)
    >> How to convert flux to fluence: flux E1 E2 (energy range)
    
    
    >> Possible solution: Group the bins! YES, this must be done in order to "remove the uncertanty"
    >> After loading the data into xspec, the high energy channels have a large uncertanty. This makes it hard to produce a good fit. 
    What should be done in this case (show a screenshot as an example)? 
    >>Another problem is that the uncertanties is larger after loading the data into xspec. 3 orders of magnitude difference between xspec and python code ?
    >> Background exposure time shown in xspec is not the same as interval chosen in python code. Why is that?

    >> Is there a command that can label the spectra in the plotting window? For example when plotting three different spectra in the same window, they have different color 
    but xspec should label the spectra.
    
    
    >> Background exposure time. Have chosen a very long bkgd_times variable, but the exposure time when loading the data into xspec is around the same as the src time. 
    Is this because the background have been calculated over the bkgd_times and then sampled over the scr_time after?
