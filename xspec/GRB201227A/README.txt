FERMI fits files have the pattern GRB201227A_*


Colors for the detectors attached plots:
	Black: Fermi, NaI 4
	Red: Fermi, NaI 8
	Green: Fermi, BGO 0
	Blue: KW, 1
	Cyan: KW, 2
	Pink: ASIM, HED


Cross corrolation done for ASIM and FERMI lightcurves to align them to T0_KW.

Spectral data retrived after cross corrolation for T0 to T0+64ms.
