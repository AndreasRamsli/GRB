ASIM MXGS HED BGO calibration coefficients for the 12 detectors as function of time.
1st column is time UTC. 2nd column is A coefficient. 3rd column is B coefficient, 4th column is C coefficient.

The A, B, C coefficients are results of the quadratic fits:
ENERGY (keV) = A * CHANNEL^2  +  B * CHANNEL   +   C

CHANNEL is between 0 and 4095.

The fits are based on the 511 keV line, the 1274.5 keV line and the proton peak (at about 31 MeV)
